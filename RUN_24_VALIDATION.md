# Run #24 Validation - window.db Timing Fix

## Timeline Issue Discovered

**Critical Discovery**: The test results in `test-results-chromium-11` were executed BEFORE the Run #24 fix was committed!

- **Test Execution**: October 14, 20:21-20:22 (8:21-8:22 PM)
- **Run #24 Commit**: October 14, 22:16:07 (10:16 PM) ‚Üê **1h 54min AFTER tests ran!**
- **Results Downloaded**: October 14, 22:23 (10:23 PM)

## The Fix (Commit 01531ab)

**Problem**: `window.db` was exposed 54 lines AFTER the `firebaseReady` event was dispatched, causing `loadAnfrage()` to execute with undefined `db`.

**Solution**: Moved `window.db` and `window.storage` exposure to IMMEDIATELY after Firestore/Storage creation (Lines 95-97 and 106-108).

## Expected Behavior After Fix

Console logs should show:
```
üî• Initializing Firebase App...
‚úÖ Firebase App initialized
‚úÖ Firestore connected to Emulator (localhost:8080)
‚úÖ Storage connected to Emulator (localhost:9199)
‚úÖ IMMEDIATE: window.db and window.storage exposed  ‚Üê NEW LOG!
‚úÖ Firebase fully initialized
```

Tests should:
- ‚úÖ Pass all 4 tests in `05-transaction-failure.spec.js`
- ‚úÖ Navigate to `anfrage-detail.html` without timeout
- ‚úÖ Load request details successfully
- ‚è±Ô∏è Complete in ~10-15 minutes

## Next Steps

1. Wait for GitHub Actions to run tests with the new code
2. Verify console logs show "IMMEDIATE: window.db" message
3. Confirm all tests pass
